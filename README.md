# FizzBuzz
A simple FizzBuzz program written in C++, inspired by Fireship.

## How it works
FizzBuzz is just a simple algorithm where it prints a sequence of number, and if that number is divisible by 3 it instead logs "Fizz", and if divisible by 5 it logs "Buzz", and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it logs "FizzBuzz".
Another addition is Bazz, which logs out "Bazz" if the number is divisible by 7.
